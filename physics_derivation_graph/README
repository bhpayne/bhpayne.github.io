The WebVOWL visualizations are created from a JSON file. Here's a template: http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/js/data/template.json
It is NOT a one-to-one representation of the ontology file (OWL, RDF, TTL), but is optimized w.r.t. VOWL.
However, the JSON can be created from an ontology file. We developed the OWL2VOWL converter for this purpose: http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html#installationOWL2VOWL


http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html#installationOWL2VOWL

The OWL2VOWL converter requires at least Java 6 to be installed on your machine. Execute the JAR file with the following command (where 'Ontology IRI' is the IRI of the ontology you would like to convert into the VOWL-JSON format):

java -jar owl2vowl.jar -iri "[Ontology IRI]"

For instance, the following command converts the FOAF vocabulary into the JSON file required for WebVOWL:

java -jar owl2vowl.jar -iri "http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/"

The converter is based on the OWL API, which can handle different OWL formats (RDF/XML, OWL/XML, Turtle, etc.). It requires at least Java 6 and comes with a README file that lists further conversion modes.
